In this project At firstI extract the feature of the images using tensorfelow library. In the second stepp I've used vgg16 for predicting the labels.
In addition I've used K- means and DBSCAN  and I found the proper k by drawing the graph for different k and find the best parameter.
In csv file there are true label of the images; In flower image file there are the images of the flower.
